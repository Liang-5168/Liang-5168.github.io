  <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->

    <div class="container card">
      <h1>Tiny Projects, Big Learning</h1>
      <p class="note">Topic chosen by the AI • ~450 words</p>
      <p>We often imagine learning as a grand staircase: heavy textbooks, long courses, and a distant
        “someday” where everything finally makes sense. In reality, progress behaves more like a
        collection of stepping-stones. Each small, finished project becomes one more stone across
        the river—the shortest path from curiosity to competence.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <section class="section why" id="why">
    <div class="container card">
      <h2>Why small beats perfect</h2>
      <p>Tiny projects lower the psychological cost of starting. When the scope is one afternoon,
        not one semester, you take more risks, iterate faster, and rack up completed reps. Each
        completion deposits a little confidence in your account. Over time, those deposits compound,
        and the work that once felt advanced becomes your new normal.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <section class="section design" id="design">
    <div class="container card">
      <h2>Designing a “tiny” that teaches</h2>
      <p>A good mini-project targets one clear skill and ships something visible. Build a one-page
        website to practice layout. Record a two-minute audio clip to learn basic editing. Scrape
        ten rows of data and chart them to understand a library’s API. What matters is that you can
        <em>finish</em>, reflect, and repeat. Scope creep is the enemy; ruthlessly trim features until
        the lesson can be learned today.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 4 -->
  <section class="section feedback" id="feedback">
    <div class="container card">
      <h2>Feedback loops over finish lines</h2>
      <p>Finishing is step one; feedback is step two. Share the result with a friend, post it in a
        community, or compare it to a reference you admire. Write down one thing that worked and one
        thing to improve next time. This tight loop—make, show, adjust—turns scattered practice into
        deliberate practice without the grind of perfectionism.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 5 -->
  <section class="section stack" id="stack">
    <div class="container card">
      <h2>Stacking stones</h2>
      <p>When tiny projects stack, they create momentum and identity. You stop saying “I’m trying to
        learn” and start saying “I build things.” That shift matters. Identity is fuel on the days
        motivation runs low. And because each project ends with something concrete, your portfolio
        naturally grows—an honest record of skills earned by doing.</p>
      <p>So pick one small idea and build it today. Tomorrow, build another. The river won’t cross
        itself, but stepping-stones are easy to lay when they’re this small.</p>
